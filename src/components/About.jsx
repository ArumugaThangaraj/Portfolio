            <p>
              I'm Joy, a Computer Science graduate with a strong foundation in front-end development and a keen eye for design. I specialize in building responsive, user-friendly web interfaces using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, and Vite.
            </p>
            <p>
              My passion lies in crafting elegant layouts, solving real-world problems through code, and continuously learning new technologies. Whether it's refining UI/UX details or debugging tricky components, I approach challenges with curiosity and persistence.
            </p>
            <p>
              I'm currently focused on expanding my portfolio with practical projects like a Weather App, BMI Calculator, and Currency Converterâ€”each designed to showcase both functionality and visual polish. I'm actively seeking opportunities to contribute to dynamic teams and grow as a developer.
